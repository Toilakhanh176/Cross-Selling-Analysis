## Tools & Techniques  
- **Programming & Environment:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, mlxtend, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, standardizing order, quantity, and pricing data)  
  - **Association Rule Mining** using Apriori Algorithm  
  - **Predictive Modeling** with Logistic Regression  
  - Predictive & Prescriptive Analysis for combo design

## Analysis Process  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and standardized transaction data.  
   - Structured product-level data for association rule mining.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed order frequency, product distribution, and sales trends.  
   - Visualized purchasing patterns with charts and heatmaps.  

3. **Association Rule Mining**  
   - Built cross-selling matrix.  
   - Applied **Apriori Algorithm** to extract frequent itemsets and rules.  

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** to predict purchase trends.  
   - Achieved model accuracy of **77% ‚Äì 93%**.  

5. **Prescriptive Analysis**  
   - Proposed optimized product combos for cross-selling.  
   - Designed actionable insights for business application.

## Results  
- Proposed **5+ optimized product combos** with high accuracy (**77% ‚Äì 93%**).  
- Delivered **cross-selling insights** applicable to:  
  - **E-commerce**  
  - **Food & Beverage (F&B)**  
  - **Retail**  
- Benefits: Increased average order value, improved customer experience, and boosted profitability.
