# 📊 Cross-selling Analysis

## Authors:
- **Bùi Mai Khanh**

## Overview  
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using **Chipotle dataset (4,622 records)**.  
The goal is to identify product associations, design optimized product combos, and provide actionable business insights to support cross-selling strategies.  

---
## 🎯 Objectives
- Increase **revenue** and **average order value** through cross-sell recommendations.
- Personalize customer experience using **behavioral data analysis**.
- Provide **prescriptive suggestions** (combos, promos, timing) for business teams.

## Tools & Techniques  
- **Programming & Environment:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, mlxtend, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, standardizing order, quantity, and pricing data)  
  - **Association Rule Mining** using Apriori Algorithm  
  - **Predictive Modeling** with Logistic Regression  
  - Predictive & Prescriptive Analysis for combo design

## Analysis Process  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and standardized transaction data.  
   - Structured product-level data for association rule mining.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed order frequency, product distribution, and sales trends.  
   - Visualized purchasing patterns with charts and heatmaps.  

3. **Association Rule Mining**  
   - Built cross-selling matrix.  
   - Applied  **Association Rules (Apriori)** with frequent itemsets, **support–confidence–lift** to detect strong cross-sell links.  

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** (with **SMOTE** for class balance) to estimate purchase likelihood of key items.
   - Achieved model accuracy of **77% – 93%**.  

5. **Prescriptive Analysis**  
   - Proposed optimized product combos for cross-selling.  
   - Designed actionable insights for business application.
